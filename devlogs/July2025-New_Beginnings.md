Today I received my parts from aliexpress. Well, most of them. I am eager to
get to work on them now, but for now I will set up this repo along with some
devlogs to keep track of my design progress.

Yesterday, I finished the most important proof of concept. I got high quality
320 kbps Mp3 files (A Morgan Wallen song) playing over bluetooth A2DP with Phil
Schatzmann's library. It's a work of art it's so simple. Now I am confident
every other piece will go smoothly as it all seems to be very common in the
maker world. New to me yes, but not exactly reinventing the wheel. Here's to
the excitement of building your own tools!!!
