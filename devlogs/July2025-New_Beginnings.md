Got the LSM303 (GY-511 package) working!  

Compared to my real reference compass, it seems off but I will call this a
calibration/heading issue.  The setup required calibrating the device by moving
it in all 3 axes while running the Calibration example found at [LSM303
Library](https://github.com/pololu/lsm303-arduino/blob/master/examples/Heading/Heading.ino)

Then I ran the Heading example and saw that the reading was not very
accurate, but I am okay with that for now. First sensor interfaced
successfully! [LSM303 Wiring Diagram](https://www.pololu.com/product/2124)

In my shipment I also got a new ESP32 dev board I ran this sensor on. It has a
slightly different pinout from what I am used to with my other boards - a
helpful pinout description was found here: [New Dev Board
Pinout](https://lastminuteengineers.com/esp32-pinout-reference/)

Today I received my parts from aliexpress. Well, most of them. I am eager to get
to work on them now, but for now I will set up this repo along with some devlogs
to keep track of my design progress.

Yesterday, I finished the most important proof of concept. I got high quality
320 kbps Mp3 files (A Morgan Wallen song) playing over bluetooth A2DP with Phil
Schatzmann's library. It's a work of art it's so simple. Now I am confident
every other piece will go smoothly as it all seems to be very common in the
maker world. New to me yes, but not exactly reinventing the wheel. Here's to the
excitement of building your own tools!!!
