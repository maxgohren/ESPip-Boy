  It is now August and I can say the real work has begun. The spectactular
dreaming phase is over and it is time to put my nose to the grindstone. To stop
being afraid of the unknown work ahead and to just do it! Today I started with
a simple 5 minutes of placing most of the labels for the USB Serial convertor.
Unfortunately that's all I could handle before becoming quite tired.

I will blame it on my jet lag from my 2 week Japan trip haha.

But that's the goal. Just chipping away at it every day, little by little.

I can already see the improvement in my PCB design skills, taking what I've
learned from the first 25 mins of Robert Feranac's ESP32 Dev Board video and
doing it on my own with no handholding, just referencing and making sure I am
on the right track.

This is very exciting for something I've never done before, watching my own
skills develop before my eyes! Here's to patience and curiosity as I walk this
unknown path!
