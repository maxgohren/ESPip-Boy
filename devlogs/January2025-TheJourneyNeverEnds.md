After waiting for my 3D printed case to come in, I assembled my watch into it's
case and wore it to work for the first time, taped together as I am still
waiting for my M1.2 aliexpress screws to hold the thing together.

I used the watch throughout the day to tell my (around 15 minutes) skewed time,
as I haven't yet programmed the watch to update it's system time from the RTC. 

I think I am happy to call this project mostly done now, as I don't see myself
redesigning the case or hardware any time soon. If the screws don't work I will
probably glue the case together. At this point, it's just software work to make
it all come together properly. And even that, I am almost done (from
a time-telling watch's functionality point of view).

I titled this month's devlog as the journey never ends because the whole point
of this watch project is to have a development platform to use the ESP32's
(mostly) entire peripheral suite in a useable tool. I say mostly because the
only thing I don't use is the ADC, which I have not heard good things about on
the ESP32 anyways.
