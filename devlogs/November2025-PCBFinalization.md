Today I looked over every connection in my schematic, placing links to the
relevant reference schematics I've collected over the past few months.

Aside from some small changes including adding some 0 Ohm bypass resistors for
my battery into my battery monitor IC, and some more for the config of my
speaker driver, I found a big problem.

My display connector is backwards! If I leave it how it is, I would have to
wire my display in upside down! I won't be fixing this today, but hopefully it
is not as disastrous as I imagine it will be. I'm so glad I caught this!

Aside from fixing the display connector, my only other plans are to review the
PCB implementation of my now fully reviewed schematic, and then add copper
fills and thick ground traces for some more safety. Other than that, this
design is looking dangerously close to order time. >:).
