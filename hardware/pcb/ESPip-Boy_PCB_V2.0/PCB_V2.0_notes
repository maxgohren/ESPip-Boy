* move display connector to remove all tension/compression on display flex connector
* make space on top of pcb for battery - move components around
* switch from smd mounts to holes for vibration/speaker -> more secure
*
* use right angle LEDs instead of discrete if you can find them
* 
* PRINT OUT PCB before manufacturing to physically check footprints against
* components!
