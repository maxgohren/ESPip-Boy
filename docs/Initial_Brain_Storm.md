# Research Questions
## Straight up JARVIS Voice Control
1. ðŸŸ¨Text-to-speech synthesizer? 
	* can definitely do, need a speaker but the audio will be robotic (low processing power)
2. ðŸŸ¨Speech-to-text machine learning model? 
	* definitely not do on board (would be limited to YES or NO processing, would need to offload to a server with WIFI (doable -> use phone 5G even, or maybe on the phone itself?))
3. âœ… Microphone onboard
	* definitely doable
1. âœ… Speaker on board

## PCB Design and Assembly
1. What tools do I need?
		* Soldering Iron, solder
		* Hot plate for SMD, solder paste
1. What is a cost effective way to get electronic components, and how would it influence my design? 
	1. For example, can I use the same kinds of filtering capacitors all over my board or do different components have different requirements?
			* Yes you can
1. What are some absolute basic design principles to follow for a successful PCB? Test pads? Etc.
	* Test Pads
	* Trace width calculations adequate for expected current
	* Big Ground Plane
	* Via minimization
	* Good silkscreen with clear names and organization of parts (don't put on vias!)
	* Design Rules Checker
1. What are some advanced design features to ensure a successful PCB?

# Hardware

	#### LiPo Battery Circuit
* TP4056 battery charging circuit
* USB input
* DW01 protection circuit
	* Discharge and Overvoltage protection
	* Requires 2 Dual-Channel N-type MOSFETs from FS8205

ChatGPT recommends LSM6DSOX as it has a built in ML core for gesture detection. That would be really cool and low power. 
I can then throw on a cheap magnetometer like the LSM6DSL for my compass app!
LGA is a pain in the ass, might have to get it assembled by PCB manufacturer.
Could also do MLC for MPU6050 in python library.
